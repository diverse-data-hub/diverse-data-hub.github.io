# Tree Cover Loss by Dominant Driver 2023

## Summary
Shows the dominant driver of tree cover loss within each 10 km grid cell and the intensity of that loss for the time period 2001-2023.

See the details on the [Global Forest Watch (GFW) page](https://data.globalforestwatch.org/documents/ff304784a9f04ac4a45a40f60bae5b26/about).

## Overview
This data set shows the dominant driver of [tree cover loss](https://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest) from 2001-2023 using the following five categories:

* Commodity-driven deforestation: Large-scale deforestation linked primarily to commercial agricultural expansion.

* Shifting agriculture: Temporary loss or permanent deforestation due to small- and medium-scale agriculture.

* Forestry: Temporary loss from plantation and natural forest harvesting, with some deforestation of primary forests.

* Wildfire: Temporary loss, does not include fire clearing for agriculture.

* Urbanization: Deforestation for expansion of urban centers.
