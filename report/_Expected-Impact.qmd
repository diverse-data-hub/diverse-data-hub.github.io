This project is expected to have a meaningful impact on data education enabling the incorporation of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) topics into the lecture room. 

By providing accessible datasets and ready-to-use analysis materials, the project equips educators with practical tools to promote socially relevant learning. 

The R package and educational website will support accessible, reproducible, data science instruction, helping students engage not only with technical skills but also with the societal implications of data. 

Ultimately, this initiative contributes to a more inclusive and informed data-literate data science community.
