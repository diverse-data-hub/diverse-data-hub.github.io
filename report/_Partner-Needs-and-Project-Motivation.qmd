The motivation behind this project comes from a growing need for educational resources that enable engagement with EDI topics through data-driven learning. This initiative seeks to fill that gap by providing two key deliverables:

- An R data package containing selected datasets focused on EDI-related topics, such as gender equity, socio-economic inclusion, and more. These datasets, provided by the partner, will be curated and documented for use in educational settings, adhering to the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/): Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability.

The FAIR data principles are foundational for data stewardship and reuse [@GOFAIR2024].

- A Quarto-based, GitHub-Pages-deployed, educational website featuring simple, interpretable teaching examples and data science projects. These examples will guide instructors through exploratory, inferential, and predictive analyses while offering contextual narratives that highlight real-world relevance and social impact.

By addressing these needs, this project not only tackles the technical challenges of data accessibility but also aims to foster data literacy through content that reflects real-world social issues.
